# Flash Kards

Quick, customizable flash cards for one to learn and memorize on the go.

## Background

This is a quick [flash card](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard) project meant to aid me in my revision for my examinations.
I have several interesting features in mind (e.g. speed testing, dictation input),
but for now, the essentials are enough to get me by.

## Roadmap

Take a look at the [projects](https://github.com/zwliew/flash-kards/projects).
